    <p> I am a PhD candidate at Bordeaux University. My research focuses on machine learning solutions for music technology with a focus on real-time capable methods. </p>
    <p> The purpose of this blog is to host some of my research but this is not the primary goal. The focus here is more on extra-curricular activities and personal (disorganised) notes on any topic I find interesting. </p>
