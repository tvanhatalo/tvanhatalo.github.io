I am a PhD candidate at Bordeaux University. My research focuses on machine learning solutions for music technology with a focus on real-time capable methods. 

Links to some of my research can be found here but the main focus here is extra-curricular activities and personal (disorganised) notes on any topic I find interesting. 

My non-scholastic interests include [reservoir computing for aiding musical creation](https://remi-audio.com/), ([playing](https://tvanhatalo.github.io/art/) and listening to) extreme metal music, science fiction, ricing (with Arch Linux), [GameBoy assembly](https://github.com/tvanhatalo/DogGame), and [alternative digital art mediums](https://tvanhatalo.github.io/art/).
