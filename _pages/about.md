I am a PhD candidate at Bordeaux University. My research focuses on machine learning solutions for music technology with a focus on real-time capable methods. 

Links to some of my research can be found here but the main focus here is extra-curricular activities and personal (disorganised) notes on any topic I find interesting. 

My non-scholastic interests include [reservoir computing for aiding musical creation](https://remi-audio.com/), (playing and listening to) extreme metal music, science fiction, ricing (with Arch Linux), GameBoy assembly, and alternative digital art mediums.
