I am a PhD candidate at Bordeaux University. My research interests concern machine learning solutions for music technology with a focus on real-time capable methods. 

Links to some of my research can be found [here](https://tvanhatalo.github.io/publications/) but the main focus here is extra-curricular activities and personal (disorganised) notes on any topic I find interesting. 

My non-scholastic interests include [reservoir computing for aiding musical creation](https://remi-audio.com/), [extreme metal music](https://tvanhatalo.github.io/art/#music), science fiction, ricing (with Arch Linux), [GameBoy assembly](https://github.com/tvanhatalo/DogGame), [alternative digital art mediums](https://tvanhatalo.github.io/art/#visual-arts), and applied mathematics (set theory at the moment).
